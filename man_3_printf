                                     Library Functions Manual                             

NAME
       _printf - print formatted output to stdout

SYNOPSIS
       #include <main.h>

       int _printf(const char *format, ...);

DESCRIPTION
       The _printf() function prints formatted output to the standard output stream (stdout). It accepts a format string
       composed of zero or more directives and produces output according to the specified format. Supported conversion
       specifiers include:

       %c     Print a single character.

       %s     Print a null-terminated string.

       %%     Print a single '%' character.

       %d, %i Print signed integers.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, _printf() returns the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to
       end output to strings). If an error occurs, a negative value is returned.

EXAMPLES
       #include <stdio.h>

       int main()
       {
            _printf("Hello, %s\n", "world");
            return (0);
       }

       This example prints "Hello, world" followed by newline.

BUGS
       There are no known bugs in this implementation.
